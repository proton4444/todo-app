## 14:18 UTC - Phase 2: Core Trading Dashboard Complete
**What We Built:**
- Created `/trading` page with real-time market data (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- Implemented order entry form (symbol, side, amount, leverage)
- Created position management with live PnL calculation
- Implemented recent trades history with status tracking
- Added portfolio summary (equity, total PnL, open positions, 24h volume)
- Added quick order buttons (Buy BTC, Sell ETH)
- Implemented real-time price updates (3s refresh)
- Added responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Added dark gradient theme (slate → purple → slate)
- Created `/api/trading` endpoint for data persistence
- Added Trading Dashboard link in Mission Control header

**Technical Details:**
- Component: `src/app/trading/page.tsx` (20336 bytes)
- API Route: `src/app/api/trading/route.ts` (3075 bytes)
- Updated Mission Control to link to trading dashboard
- All Phase 2 tasks completed (10/10)

**Progress Update:**
- Phase 1: 100% complete (10/10 tasks)
- Phase 2: 100% complete (10/10 tasks)
- Overall: 30% complete (20/66 tasks)
- Next: Phase 3: MCP Integration (8 tasks, 2 hours)

**Vercel Deployment:**
- Commit: `b807137` - Complete Phase 2
- Pushed to GitHub: proton4444/todo-app
- Vercel auto-deploying (~2-3 minutes)
- URLs:
  - Mission Control: https://todo-app-umber-chi-47.vercel.app/
  - Trading Dashboard: https://todo-app-umber-chi-47.vercel.app/trading

## 12:56 UTC - SSH Key Setup & Deployment Fix
**Problem:** Could not push to GitHub due to missing SSH key
**Solution:**
- Generated SSH key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (4096-bit RSA)
- Added to SSH agent: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- Public key added to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
- **From now on: Use SSH for GitHub push (not HTTPS)**

**Key Location:** `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
**Public Key for GitHub:** Already added as "OpenClaw EC2"

**Vercel Deployment:**
- Build fixed by removing unused TradingDashboard.tsx component
- Push to GitHub triggers automatic Vercel deployment
- Project: https://github.com/proton4444/todo-app.git

## 12:19 UTC - New JSX Coding Rules
**User Rule:** When generating JSX:
1. Match opening/closing tags with same name for semantic HTML elements (<header></header>, <main></main>, <nav></nav>, etc.) and React component wrappers (<DndProvider></DndProvider>, <Provider></Provider>, etc.)
2. Never close semantic tags as </div> - breaks DOM structure
3. Define all functions/constants BEFORE using them (showNotification, COLUMN_TITLES, etc.)
4. RUN BUILD before pushing to GitHub - catch errors early

**Rationale:** Prevents broken builds and undefined reference errors

## 12:30 UTC - PostgreSQL as Distributed Cache (Future Tech)
**Concept:** Use PostgreSQL unlogged tables as high-performance distributed cache
**Key Points:**
- Unlogged tables bypass Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) = 30% faster writes
- Eliminates Redis dependency, simplifies stack
- Tradeoff: cache data volatile (lost on crash - acceptable for caching)
- Use cases: multi-instance deployments, rate limiting, API response caching
- Node.js equivalents: `node-pg-memoize`, custom implementation
- Reference: "PostgreSQL as a Distributed Cache" by Milan Jovanović (YouTube)
**Status:** Added to future tech exploration list - not needed for current to-do app
